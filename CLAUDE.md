# LLM Wiki Agent — Schema & Workflow Instructions

This wiki is maintained entirely by Claude Code. No API key or Python scripts needed — just open this repo in Claude Code and talk to it.

## Slash Commands (Claude Code)

| Command | What to say |
|---|---|
| `/wiki-ingest` | `ingest raw/my-article.md` |
| `/wiki-query` | `query: what are the main themes?` |
| `/wiki-lint` | `lint the wiki` |
| `/wiki-graph` | `build the knowledge graph` |

Or just describe what you want in plain English:
- *"Ingest this file: raw/papers/attention-is-all-you-need.md"*
- *"What does the wiki say about transformer models?"*
- *"Check the wiki for orphan pages and contradictions"*
- *"Build the graph and show me what's connected to RAG"*

Claude Code reads this file automatically and follows the workflows below.

## When Using the Wiki

## Ingestion Queue

The ingestion queue is managed by file location, and visualized in `queue.md`:

- `raw/` — files waiting to be ingested (queue)
- `processed/` — files that have been successfully ingested (done)

**After every successful ingest**, move the source file and update `queue.md`:
```bash
mv raw/<filename> processed/<filename>
~/self_created_tools/update_queue.sh
```

To see what's left to ingest:
```bash
ls raw/*.md | wc -l    # count remaining
ls raw/*.md             # list remaining
```

To see what's been processed:
```bash
ls processed/*.md | wc -l
```

---

## Page Format

Every wiki page uses this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
type: source | entity | concept | synthesis | character | chapter | location | conflict | theme | timeline-event | rule | arc | dramatica | reader-state | foreshadowing
tags: []
sources: []       # list of source slugs that inform this page
requires: []      # list of page slugs this page depends on (depth 2)
informs: []       # list of page slugs this page informs (unbounded)
valid_from: ""    # timeline-event slug
valid_until: ""   # timeline-event slug
traits: {}        # specialized key-value pairs (e.g. voice_profile)
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

Use `[[PageName]]` wikilinks to link to other wiki pages.

## Ingest Workflow

Triggered by: *"ingest <file>"* or `/wiki-ingest`

This workflow runs the LLM-First Chunk Loop using the unified `wiki-ingest-workflow`. It replaces the old monolithic ingest Python scripts.

Steps (orchestrated by `.claude/skills/wiki-ingest-workflow/SKILL.md`):
1. **Route**: Execute `ingest_router.py` to route to L0 (immutable fact node) and L1 (episode node).
2. **Chunk**: Run `python3 tools/chunk.py memory/L0_facts/<file>` to chunk the file semantically.
3. **Compile & Decompose**: For each chunk, run `compile_context.py` to build the prompt, then call `wiki-decompose` to generate a comprehensive plan.
4. **Layer Passes**: Call `wiki-ingest-knowledge`, `wiki-ingest-narrative`, and `wiki-ingest-reader` iteratively for each chunk based on the generated plan.
5. **Merge Check**: Use `index_manager.py` to check for duplicates and prevent schema conflicts.
6. **Validation Loop**: Each pass validates its output using `validate.py` and retries on failure (up to 3x).
7. **Cleanup**: Rebuild index, append to `log.md`, and clean up temporary chunks. NEVER move or delete from `raw/`.

### Source Page Format

```markdown
---
title: "Source Title"
type: source
tags: []
date: YYYY-MM-DD
source_file: raw/...
---

## Summary
2–4 sentence summary.

## Key Claims
- Claim 1
- Claim 2

## Key Quotes
> "Quote here" — context

## Connections
- [[EntityName]] — how they relate
- [[ConceptName]] — how it connects

## Contradictions
- Contradicts [[OtherPage]] on: ...
```

---

## Query Workflow

Triggered by: *"query: <question>"* or `/wiki-query`

Steps:
1. Read `wiki/index.md` to identify relevant pages
2. Read those pages with the Read tool
3. Synthesize an answer with inline citations as `[[PageName]]` wikilinks
4. Ask the user if they want the answer filed as `wiki/syntheses/<slug>.md`

---

## Lint Workflow

Triggered by: *"lint the wiki"* or `/wiki-lint`

Use Grep and Read tools to check for:
- **Orphan pages** — wiki pages with no inbound `[[links]]` from other pages
- **Broken links** — `[[WikiLinks]]` pointing to pages that don't exist
- **Contradictions** — claims that conflict across pages
- **Stale summaries** — pages not updated after newer sources
- **Missing entity pages** — entities mentioned in 3+ pages but lacking their own page
- **Data gaps** — questions the wiki can't answer; suggest new sources
- **Novel-specific checks** — orphan characters, timeline gaps, foreshadowing with no resolution, `constraint_refs` to non-existent rules, `terminology_permitted` ratchet violations.

Output a lint report and ask if the user wants it saved to `wiki/lint-report.md`.

---

## Graph Workflow

Triggered by: *"build the knowledge graph"* or `/wiki-graph`

When the user asks to build the graph, run `tools/build_graph.py` which:
- Pass 1: Parses all `[[wikilinks]]` and `requires:`/`informs:` relationships → deterministic `EXTRACTED` edges
- Pass 2: Infers implicit relationships → `INFERRED` edges with confidence scores
- Runs Louvain community detection
- Outputs `graph/graph.json` + `graph/graph.html`

If the user doesn't have Python/dependencies set up, instead generate the graph data manually:
1. Use Grep to find all `[[wikilinks]]` across wiki pages
2. Build a node/edge list
3. Write `graph/graph.json` directly
4. Write `graph/graph.html` using the vis.js template

---

## Naming Conventions

- Source slugs: `kebab-case` matching source filename
- Entity pages: `TitleCase.md` (e.g. `OpenAI.md`, `SamAltman.md`)
- Concept pages: `TitleCase.md` (e.g. `ReinforcementLearning.md`, `RAG.md`)
- Character pages: `TitleCase.md`
- Chapter pages: `chapter-NN.md`
- Location pages: `TitleCase.md`
- Conflict pages: `TitleCase.md`
- Theme pages: `TitleCase.md`
- Timeline events: `NNN-slug.md`
- Rule pages: `TitleCase.md`
- Arc pages: `kebab-case.md`
- Dramatica pages: `TitleCase.md`
- Reader-state pages: `chapter-NN-state.md`
- Foreshadowing pages: `kebab-case.md`
- Outline pages: `chapter-NN-outline.md`
- Beat pages: `chapter-NN-beat-NN.md`
- Manuscript pages: `chapter-NN-manuscript.md`

## When Developing the Wiki System

## Development Roadmap (todo/)

The wiki is being extended for novel-author use. Detailed specs live in `docs/`, phased implementation plan in `todo/`.

See `Concept.md` for the overall vision and architecture overview. See `handover.md` for open questions and ideas.

### Reference Specs

| Spec | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `docs/wiki-schema.md` | 14 page types, frontmatter, templates, traits, temporal fields |
| `docs/navigation-system.md` | `requires:/informs:` dependency, temporal filtering, context ceilings |
| `docs/agent-workflows.md` | 12 workflows: 8 core + 4 writing pipeline |
| `docs/reader-model.md` | Reader progressive disclosure, terminology ratchet, foreshadowing |
| `docs/dramatica-integration.md` | Dramatica Theory mapping to wiki pages |
| `docs/writing-pipeline.md` | Beats, outlines, manuscripts — the 4-stage writing pipeline |

### Validation Loop
All agent skills that modify wiki content must employ a validation loop:
1. Agent writes markdown to disk.
2. Agent runs `python3 tools/validate.py --recent-minutes 5`
3. If the tool reports `FAIL` (exit code 1) and lists errors, the agent MUST retry the write operation to fix the reported schema, type, or index consistency issues.
4. The agent may retry up to 3 times per chunk or task.

### Writing Pipeline

The writing pipeline separates chapter specs from structural planning and prose:

```
Chapter (spec) → Outline (structure) → Beats (atomic scenes) → Manuscript (prose)
```

Four dedicated workflows: `outline-writing`, `beat-detailing`, `manuscript-drafting`, `manuscript-revision`. The `chapter-writing` workflow orchestrates by delegating to the right stage.

### Session Start Protocol (MANDATORY)

Every session that touches wiki structure or implementation:
1. Read `todo/README.md` — find the active phase (first phase with status != `complete`)
2. Read `todo/meta/README.md` — validation rules, contradiction hierarchy, wiki hygiene
3. Read the active phase's `README.md` in `todo/phase-N-*/`
4. Continue from the first unchecked task in that phase

### Rules
- Mark tasks `- [x]` immediately after completing them
- Update phase status when all tasks in a phase complete
- Load `docs/` specs ONLY when the active task references them
- NEVER read inactive phase folders (status `not-started` or `complete`)
- Flag contradictions — never silently resolve them (log to `wiki/meta/contradiction-log.md`)
- Archive deprecated content to `wiki/archive/` — never delete wiki pages
- Follow contradiction hierarchy: `rule > source > character > chapter > synthesis`
- **Every `wiki/` subfolder MUST have a `README.md`** with navigational info — update it whenever pages are added, removed, or archived (see `todo/meta/README.md` for template)

## Developer Enhancements
